NAME
    Perl::Portable - Support code for "Perl on a Stick"

DESCRIPTION
    THIS MODULE IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

    YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

    "Portable" is a term used for applications that are installed onto a
    portable storage device (most commonly a USB memory stick) rather than
    onto a single host.

    This technique has become very popular for Windows applications, as it
    allows a user to make use of their own software on typical publically
    accessible computers at libraries, hotels and internet cafes.

    Converting a Windows application into portable form has a specific set
    of challenges, as the application has no access to the Windows registry,
    no access to "My Documents" type directories, and does not exist at a
    reliable filesystem path (because the portable storage medium can be
    mounted at an arbitrary volume or filesystem location).

    Perl::Portable provides a methodology and implementation to support the
    creating of "Portable Perl" distributions. While this will initially be
    focused on a Windows implementation, wherever possible the module will
    be built to be platform-agnostic.

    For now, see the code for more...
